# GraphQL-Spotify

A simple GraphQL layer for Spotify API built with Koa.

## Goal

This project is not about implement all query for the Spotify API. It's just about create a GraphQL server with Koa!

## Running the app

Before anything, you have to create a Spotify app (see https://beta.developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications). Then, you have to fill the `development.json` with your credentials.

```
# install dependencies
yarn

# run the app
yarn dev

# run linter
yarn lint

# run tests
yarn test
```
